## OpenvSwiper.sh
The OpenvSwiper is a bash script which removes OpenvStorage & its dependencies from a server. Use this script before you re-install Open vStorage on the node.

**WARNING:** This script wipes all the disks / partitions that are not in use by the operating system. It wipes the content of `/root/.ssh/`.
